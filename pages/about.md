# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** .<br>

Welcome to my blog. I am a data scientist currently stuying at University of Chicago. I am passionate about using data to show things that we are not often aware of in life. 

I believe that the key to economic growth is not the allocation of endowments, but innovation. Economics should focus more on the details and relatively assumption-free aspects of actual economic development and production activities, rather than following Robert Solow's path. These details, which have a broad space for exploration, may include the connection between basic research and technology, how the patent system promotes the dissemination of knowledge, how organizations acquire and learn knowledge, and at what level the free market is free (production factors? Information?) Will changes in the free market be accompanied by changes in traditionally considered non-market elements? It is these more specific institutional and practical details that reveal people's real production process.

With data, I wish to show these details more accurately and objectively.

Outside school, I love coding, cooking, hiking and reading. Feel free to contact me.
