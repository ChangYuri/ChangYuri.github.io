  description: I studied Political Science and Economics. I mainly focused on 
                Industrial Policy and Political Economy. I am familiar with Neo-Schumpeterian Economics
                and am interested in how government-led industrial policy can possibly create new 
                space for firms to innovate and grow. I also did research on administrative reform 
                and election.
