## How does reverse engineering work?



<span style = "font-style: oblique">
    Over 80% of the increase in output per man-hour is attributable to technical change.- Robert Solow</span>

The concept of reverse engineering is of great importance in political and industrial economics. This blog is not a serious work, nor does it pay sufficient attention to the latest results in the academic world, but merely aims to introduce the reader to the micro-practices of reverse engineering and pros and cons of reverse engineering in innovation theory, as well as to provide some discussion of knowledge acquisition and assimilation. 

A few core points of this article are that (1) reverse engineering is widespread in the development of human civilization; (2) reverse engineering can directly bring short-term economic benefits by facilitating production under certain conditions, and (3) it may also simultaneously be able to help narrow the technological gap from the perspectives of innovation and technological catch-up. (4) The limitation of reverse engineering is that from an epistemological point of view, some core knowledge cannot be accessed, and without this component, it cannot be useful at the level of technology and long-term economic development. The logic of this blog rests on the assumption that technological development leads to economic growth.

#### - What is Reverse Engineering<br>

Reverse engineering is an industrial term. There are usually two types of engineering, forward engineering and reverse engineering. In a narrower sense, "the process of retrieving new geometry from a manufactured part by digitizing and modifying an existing CAD model." The term has been greatly expanded from engineering to include, at the broader end of the spectrum there is “the basic concept of producing a part based on an original or physical model without the use of an engineering drawing “.[1]. At the more social science or economics end of the spectrum, the term is generalized to mean the process of extracting know-how or knowledge from a human-made artifact [2]. This includes not only prototypes, but also parts, blueprint, etc., Reverse engineering is how, given a product (in the broadest sense), one can deduce backwards the technical details of its use and its production.

In this blog, we want to distinguish between reverse engineering as action and reverse engineering as definition. I wish to point out that many subjects attempt to reverse engineer but end up not extracting know-how or knowledge. Rather than reverse engineering, they de-modularize, disassemble and replicate instead.

#### - Reverse engineering is widespread in human history<br>

The main assertion of mainstream new institutionalist economics is that <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">institutions matter.</span> Property rights are important as a key institution in modern capitalist societies. Traditionally, scholars would argue for the importance of property rights systems in terms of transaction costs (Coase) and incentives. Reverse engineering is a term that, at the economic level, is a betrayal of the property rights system from birth. Numerous accusations have been made that reverse engineering, in practice, undermines the principle of free competition by violating the property rights of others. However, while many of these cases focus on the manufacturing and software boom of the last century, the practice was historically born with the Industrial Revolution. In engineering discipline, reverse engineering is a content that specifically needs to be learned. Historically, the most famous example is Samuel Slater, known as the “Father of the American Industrial Revolution” (but as “Slater the Traitor” to the British). Samuel Slater was apprenticed to textile mill owner Jedidiah Strutt, who was also the business partner of the inventor Richard Arkwright, and spent many years learning about the workings of the mill and the industry as a whole. He learned in his years of study how these mills, and indeed the entire production system of the industry, worked. He memorized the technical details with an amazing memory and came to the United States to help others rebuild the machines and establish the factory[3]. It is also worth noting that, Samuel was in fact opposed to union organizing, exploited workers, and relocated the factory system he founded to the South, which was heavily dependent on slavery. 

#### - Reverse engineering’s influence  

Clearly, Samuel's actions helped the American industrial system. This logic seems well understood, but it is at odds with the theory of institutional economics. We need to carefully discern exactly how this positive effect was realized. From a short-run production perspective, the United States has a superbly large market demand, and a local factory that produces at a rate greater than or at least equal to that of the British factory would, of course, bring great economic benefits. During that time, US as a late-comer did successfully bridge the technology gap, especially when the technology is still reletively easy to decipher. 
This is the primary and most criticized purpose of reverse engineering in contemporary late-developing countries. A large number of developing countries use reverse engineering (de facto copycats) to cut costs and satisfy large amounts of demand. The short-term economic benefits of this behavior need not be over-argued, as it has been confirmed by a large number of cases emerging in the international market.

And from the perspective of long-term technological development. Not all attempts at reverse engineering have resulted in long-term gains. As mentioned earlier, the core of reverse engineering lies in the ability to really dig out the technology behind the product. Early 21st century China introduced a large number of foreign capital to build factories in China, after the initial meet the domestic and foreign demand for automobile manufacturing, a large number of foreign automobile technology has not been transformed by domestic enterprises. Domestic partners were still unable to build cars on their own. Japan, on the other hand, despite a great deal of reverse engineering after the war, has mastered and innovated a great deal of technology through independent learning. (The book edited by Nelson also summarizes each country's innovation system in detail.[4])

#### - Understanding the shortcomings of reverse engineering from an epistemological perspective  

In the dimension of firm and industry attempts, this discrepancy is of course due to a variety of factors, such as the original producer's considerations of preventing technological migration. But in terms of the purest practice of reverse engineering a single product, there is necessarily some knowledge that cannot be directly reverse engineered anyway.

In this world, the knowledge that we can know can be divided into two categories, one called <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">tacit knowledge</span> and the other called <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">explicit knowledge</span>. Tacit knowledge refers to the kind of knowledge that we cannot speak or describe; whereas in explicit knowledge, what we have explicitly described is coded knowledge, and what has not yet been explicitly described is non-coded knowledge. Some human practices are essentially attempts to encode explicit knowledge more, like writing and telling. Some are the attempts to share tacit knowledge by ptacticing feeling, like apprenticeship system

And since (1) a great deal of human knowledge is necessarily still acquired from experience, the source of which cannot be realized or exhausted, and (2) each person's experience is necessarily somewhat different, there is necessarily no way for us to translate all of it. As an example, temperature is explicit knowledge because we can all describe the common sensation of hot and cold, and the thermometer is our attempt at encoding it. And there is some knowledge that can almost never be encoded. If you ask an expert in the art of love for advice, he's likely to respond with a simple “it’s all about feelings”; if someone asks you how to ride a bicycle, you're unlikely to offer much more than “try to keep your balance with both feet on the pedals”. The most accomplished gourmet will fail even using as many terms as possible to describe the flavor of a meal to someone.
Ultimately, the essence of reverse engineering is to have complete knowledge of the product. But encoding all the explicit knowledge embedded in the product is difficult enough; learning the tacit knowledge is almost impossible. For example, replicating a dish: we try to rediscover or learn directly all the ingredients, the steps, the quantities, etc. It is almost impossible to realize that the material and thickness of the cookware I use, the altitude and temperature of my kitchen, and the location of the ingredients I purchase will also all affect the results of my reverse engineering. We are already in trouble with explicit knowledge.

And a product has a great deal of more tacit knowledge. These knowledge don't come along with even blueprint. These knowledege is learned by the practive over time. Engineers and workers are never trained in a classroom because it takes a lot of time and practice to acquire tacit knowledge, and it is difficult to acquire it quickly through reverse engineering.

How tight is a screw really tightened? How is the lathe supposed to vibrate when it's running? Understanding all the details of saddle from mongols and replicating it doesn't mean you can harness a horse.
 
In addition, there is a great deal of organizational-level knowledge that needs to be migrated and replicated, which will not be discussed at this time.

Note that Samuel is the designer of the “Rhode Island System of Manufacture”. He did not just reverse engineer the construction of the machine itself, he completely mastered the textile technology and all the system setups during his years of apprenticeship, and thus at the same time restored all the knowledge of the production process, including the tacit knowledge, which could not simply be transmitted from the drawings.


#### - Summary:
This blog reviews how reverse engineering can lead to short and long term economic gains. In areas where there is a demand for this behavior, the market itself has shown its advantages in short-term supply and demand issues. From the perspective of long-term technological development, reverse engineering must be able to truly unearth the technical knowledge behind the product, thus driving part of the subject's understanding of the technology. However, due to the natural limitations of people's access to knowledge, reverse engineering is always necessarily limited.

(Knowledge in the field of programming, on the other hand, is markedly different from that of industrial production, with the former having a much higher proportion of explicit knowledge than the latter, which means that while purely copying code can never make one a good programmer, copying code with one's brain is still likely to make one a good programmer.)
