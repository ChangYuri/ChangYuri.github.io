## "City-County merge"

Administrative divisions are the result of long-term historical evolution and development, and political districts are adjusted and reformed in due course to meet the needs of continuous economic and social development. In China, local governments have roughly two different forms, County(县 xian) and District(区 qu). Usually and typically, counties are rural or semi-urban, with agriculture playing a significant role. They are directly governed by a prefecture-level(地级市) or autonomous prefecture. While districts are urban or suburban, they are also part of a prefecture-level city, and are usually more tightly integrated into city's urban planning, economy and infrastructure etc.

 In China, the “reform of removing counties and setting them up as districts” (In english literature this is often referred as City-County merge, although this is not the typical merge we think) is an important administrative restructuring in recent years, involving the reorganization of county-level administrative units (counties or county-level cities) into municipal districts, which provides a unique opportunity to understand the drivers and policy effects of administrative restructuring.

 The paper examines the outcome on government scale of this reform.

## Findings

We find that city-county merge has no significant effect on administrative expenditures and financial support staff. Further heterogeneity analysis reveals that county abolition promotes the expansion of government size in the eastern region and reduces government size in the central and western regions. The effect of city-county merge on government size depends on the level of local economic development. city-county merge is more likely to promote the expansion of government size in regions with developed economies, high fiscal revenues, and high urbanization rates. In addition, we find that city-county merge has a contraction effect as the tenure of county leaders increases. These results suggest that the effect of city-county merge on government size depends on the level of local development and the incentives of local leaders.
